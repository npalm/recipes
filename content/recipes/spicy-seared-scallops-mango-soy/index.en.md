An elegant starter featuring seared scallops with a sweet and savory mango chutney, finished with a hint of red pepper for a subtle kick. Perfect for a special dinner.

## Components

### Mango Chutney

#### Ingredients

- 1 ripe mango {scale}
- 1 tbsp olive oil {scale}
- 1/2 shallot, finely chopped {scale}
- 1/2 mild red chili, seeds removed and finely chopped {scale}
- 20 ml soy sauce {scale}
- Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped {scale}

#### Instructions

1. Peel the mango. Puree half of the flesh using a food processor, blender, or immersion blender. Dice the other half into small cubes and refrigerate, covered.

2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the shallot and red chili for a few minutes until softened.

3. Reduce the heat and add the mango puree to the pan. Stir in 10 ml of soy sauce and the chopped thyme. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for a few minutes, then taste and adjust with more soy sauce if needed. The chutney should have a good balance of sweet, salty, and spicy.

4. Let the chutney cool and store covered in the refrigerator until ready to use. Can be made up to a day in advance.

### Scallops

#### Ingredients

- 12 scallops {scale}
- 2 tbsp arachide oil (or other neutral oil with high smoke point) {scale}
- Pinch of salt

#### Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with the arachide oil. Once the oil is shimmering and almost smoking, place the scallops in the pan and season with a pinch of salt.

2. Cook for 1-1.5 minutes per side until golden brown. The center should remain slightly translucent. Don't move the scallops while searing to get a good crust.

3. Alternatively, grill the scallops in a grill pan. Brush them with a little arachide oil and grill for 1-1.5 minutes per side.

### Montage

#### Ingredients

- Black pepper, to taste
- Leaves from 1 sprig fresh thyme, for garnish
- Enoki mushrooms, for garnish (optional)
- Roasted pistachios, roughly chopped, for garnish (optional)
- Red chili threads, for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions

1. Just before serving, reheat the mango chutney over low heat in a small pan and stir in the chilled mango cubes.

2. Arrange 3 scallops per plate (preferably pre-warmed). Season with freshly ground black pepper.

3. Spoon the warm mango chutney with mango cubes over and around the scallops.

4. Garnish with fresh thyme leaves, enoki mushrooms, roasted pistachios, and red chili threads. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- For easier and more even cooking, slice each scallop horizontally in half before frying. This way they cook through perfectly in less time.
- Use good quality soy sauce for the best flavor.
- The chutney can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
- Don't overcook the scallops or they will become rubbery.
- This dish pairs well with a Pinot Gris wine.
