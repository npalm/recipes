An elegant starter featuring seared scallops with a sweet and savory mango-soy sauce, finished with a hint of red pepper for a subtle kick. Perfect for a special dinner.

## Ingredients

- 1 ripe mango {scale}
- 15 g butter (for the sauce) {scale}
- 1/2 shallot, finely chopped {scale}
- 1/2 mild red chili, seeds removed and finely chopped {scale}
- 20 ml soy sauce {scale}
- Leaves from 3 sprigs fresh thyme, finely chopped {scale}
- 12 scallops {scale}
- 2 tbsp arachide oil (or other neutral oil) {scale}
- Black pepper, to taste
- Leaves from 1 sprig fresh thyme, for garnish
- Pinch of salt
- Enoki mushrooms, for garnish (optional)
- Roasted pistachios, roughly chopped, for garnish (optional)
- Red chili threads, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Peel the mango. Puree half of the flesh using a food processor, blender, or immersion blender. Dice the other half into small cubes and refrigerate, covered.

2. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the shallot and red chili for a few minutes until softened.

3. Reduce the heat and add the mango puree to the pan. Stir in 10 ml of soy sauce and the chopped thyme. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for a few minutes, then taste and adjust with more soy sauce if needed. The sauce should have a good balance of sweet, salty, and spicy.

4. Let the sauce cool and store covered in the refrigerator until ready to use.

5. Just before serving: reheat the sauce over low heat in a small pan and stir in the chilled mango cubes.

6. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with the arachide oil. Once the oil is shimmering, place the scallops in the pan and season with a pinch of salt. Cook for 1-1.5 minutes per side until golden brown. The center should remain slightly translucent.

7. Optional: you can also grill the scallops in a grill pan. Brush them with a little arachide oil and grill for 1-1.5 minutes per side.

8. Arrange 3 scallops per plate (preferably pre-warmed). Season with freshly ground black pepper and spoon the mango sauce with mango cubes over the scallops. Garnish with fresh thyme leaves, enoki mushrooms, roasted pistachios, and red chili threads. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- For easier and more even cooking, slice each scallop horizontally in half before frying. This way they cook through perfectly in less time.
- Use good quality soy sauce for the best flavor.
- The sauce can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
- Don't overcook the scallops or they will become rubbery.
- This dish pairs well with a Pinot Gris wine.
