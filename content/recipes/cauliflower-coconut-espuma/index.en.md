cookTime: 25

#### Ingredients

**Base:**
- 350 g cauliflower florets {scale}
- 150 ml full-fat coconut milk {scale}
- 100 ml vegetable broth {scale}

**Aromatics:**
- 1 shallot, finely chopped {scale}
- 1 tsp mild curry powder {scale}
- 1 tbsp olive oil {scale}

**Stabilizer:**
- 0.5 g xanthan gum (small pinch) {scale}

**Garnish:**
- 30 g cashew nuts, toasted and coarsely chopped {scale}
- Chili oil or fresh coriander

#### Equipment

- 500ml espuma siphon
- 1 N2O charger
- Fine sieve
- Immersion blender or blender

#### Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a pan and sauté the finely chopped shallot until translucent, about {{3}} minutes.

2. Add the curry powder and cook briefly until fragrant, about {{30}} seconds.

3. Add the cauliflower florets, coconut milk and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil.

4. Simmer the cauliflower until very soft, about {{15-20}} minutes.

5. Blend the mixture with an immersion blender or blender until silk-smooth. Add the xanthan gum and blend for another {{30}} seconds.

6. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into the 500ml siphon for an ultra-smooth texture.

7. Close the siphon and charge with 1 N2O charger. Shake well (at least {{10}} times).

8. Keep warm in a water bath at maximum 65°C until serving.

9. Meanwhile, toast the cashew nuts in a dry pan until golden brown and chop coarsely.

#### Serving

1. Dispense the espuma into pre-warmed bowls or glasses.

2. Garnish with toasted cashew nuts and a few drops of chili oil or fresh coriander.

3. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- The base can be made a few hours in advance and stored in the siphon
- Make sure the espuma does not get warmer than 65°C, otherwise it may separate
- Always shake the siphon well before use for optimal results
- You can also use puffed quinoa or amaranth as a crunchy garnish
- For a vegetarian version: use vegetable broth; for vegan: ensure all ingredients are plant-based
