- The tuna should be seared very briefly - the inside must remain raw.
- Serve cold or at room temperature.
- This dish is perfect as a refined appetizer or as part of a Japanese-inspired menu.
- Store the sauces separately and add just before serving for the best presentation.
- Optionally serve on a bed of sea asparagus (samphire) or with sea asparagus tempura for extra texture and a fresh sea-salt flavor.
