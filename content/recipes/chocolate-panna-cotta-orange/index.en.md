## Components

### Chocolate Panna Cotta
prepTime: 15
cookTime: 10
waitTime: 120

#### Ingredients

- 2.5 sheets gelatin {scale}
- 200 ml heavy cream {scale}
- 20 g sugar {scale}
- 75 g dark chocolate {scale}
- 50 ml strong coffee {scale}
- 50 ml amaretto {scale}

#### Instructions

1. Soak 2 sheets of gelatin in cold water for {{5-10}} minutes.

2. Bring the cream with sugar to a boil in a saucepan.

3. Remove from heat and squeeze out the gelatin. Dissolve the gelatin in the warm cream by stirring well.

4. Meanwhile, melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler. Stir in the coffee and amaretto until you have a smooth mixture.

5. Gently pour the chocolate mixture into the cream while stirring continuously until everything is well combined.

6. Let the mixture cool to lukewarm (about {{10-15}} minutes), stirring regularly to prevent a skin from forming.

7. When the mixture starts to thicken nicely, divide it between 2 glasses or molds.

8. Let it set for at least {{2}} hours in the refrigerator, but check after {{1}} hour if the top is firm enough for the jelly layer.

### Orange Jelly
prepTime: 5
cookTime: 5
waitTime: 60

#### Ingredients

- 100 ml fresh orange juice {scale}
- 0.5 sheets gelatin (from the previously soaked 2.5 sheets) {scale}
- 1 tsp sugar (optional) {scale}

#### Instructions

1. Soak the half sheet of gelatin in cold water for {{5-10}} minutes.

2. Bring the orange juice to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a teaspoon of sugar to taste if desired.

3. Remove from heat, squeeze out the gelatin and dissolve it in the warm juice.

4. Let the jelly cool to lukewarm.

5. When the panna cotta in the glasses is thick enough (after about {{1-1.5}} hours), carefully pour a thin layer of orange jelly over the panna cotta.

6. Let the whole thing set for at least another {{2}} hours in the refrigerator (so at least 3-4 hours total chilling time).

### Orange Tuiles
prepTime: 10
cookTime: 10
waitTime: 15

#### Ingredients

- 40 g powdered sugar {scale}
- 25 g butter {scale}
- 15 g flour {scale}
- 20 ml fresh orange juice {scale}
- 0.5 tsp orange marmalade {scale}

#### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F).

2. Melt the butter in a small saucepan.

3. Mix the melted butter with powdered sugar, orange juice, marmalade and flour in a bowl until you have a smooth, even batter.

4. Let the batter firm up briefly in the refrigerator, about {{10-15}} minutes.

5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon small mounds of about 1 teaspoon of batter onto the sheet with plenty of space between them (they will spread).

6. Bake the tuiles for about {{10}} minutes in the preheated oven. Watch them carefully so they turn golden brown but don't burn.

7. Let the tuiles cool completely on the baking sheet (they will become crispy as they cool).

8. Store in an airtight container until serving.

## Serving

Serve the panna cotta in glasses with 1-2 orange tuiles on the side or on top. Optionally garnish with some grated orange zest or a sprig of mint.

## Notes

- The panna cotta and tuiles can be made a day in advance
- Make sure the panna cotta is firm enough before adding the jelly layer, otherwise the layers will mix
- The tuiles only become truly crispy after cooling
- Store the tuiles separately and add only when serving to keep them crispy
- You can replace the amaretto with more coffee or milk for an alcohol-free version
- Use fresh orange juice for the best result
