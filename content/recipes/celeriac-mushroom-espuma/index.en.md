### Celeriac Straw - The Crunch

**Prep time:** 10 minutes  
**Cook time:** 5 minutes

#### Ingredients

- 50 g {scale} celeriac, peeled
- Frying oil (for deep frying)
- Sea salt

5. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
6. Sprinkle immediately with a little sea salt.
7. Use immediately for best crispness.

## Plating and Assembly

1. Divide the warm mushrooms between two plates and stack them in the center.
2. Shake the siphon once more and hold it upside down.
3. Dispense a generous dome of celeriac espuma on top of the mushrooms.
4. Garnish immediately with a tuft of crispy celeriac straw on top of the espuma.
5. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- **Timing:** The espuma can be kept in the siphon for 2-3 hours in warm water. Prepare the mushrooms and straw just before serving.
- **Siphon essential:** This recipe requires a siphon (also called an espuma whipper) with N2O chargers. These are available at kitchen supply stores.
- **Safety:** Work carefully with the hot frying oil. Make sure the celeriac is thoroughly dry before frying.
- **Wine pairing:** Pair with a mineral white wine such as Chablis or German Riesling. The freshness and minerality complement the earthy mushrooms and creamy celeriac perfectly.
- **Variation:** Replace the wild mushrooms with shiitakes or a mix of wild mushrooms for more depth.
