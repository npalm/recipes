### Fruit Duo (Pear & Persimmon)
prepTime: 15

The fresh counterpoint that completes the dish.

#### Ingredients

- 1 firm pear (e.g., Conference) {scale}
- 1 ripe persimmon (Sharon fruit) {scale}
- A drop of lime juice
- A little sugar

#### Instructions

1. Pear: Peel the pear and cut into very small cubes (brunoise). Mix with a drop of lime juice and a little sugar to prevent browning.

2. Persimmon: Cut the persimmon into thin, elegant slices (carpaccio-style). Use raw.

## Plating

Remove the lime parfait from the mold and place on the plate. Arrange the meringue shards around it, sprinkle the chocolate-pistachio crumble over it, add the pear brunoise and persimmon slices.

## Notes

- Many components can be made ahead of time
- Parfait and meringue can be made in parallel (parfait freezes while meringue dries in the oven)
- Cut fruit just before serving for optimal freshness
- Meringue can be made several days ahead and stored in an airtight container
- Ensure all equipment for the meringue is grease-free for best results
