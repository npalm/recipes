A festive starter featuring seared scallops paired with a flavorful soy sauce, mango, and thyme combination. Perfect for a special occasion or holiday dinner.

## Ingredients

- 1 ripe mango {scale}
- Butter (for cooking) {scale}
- 1/2 shallot, finely chopped {scale}
- 1/2 mild red chili (e.g., Spanish pepper), seeds removed and finely chopped {scale}
- 20 ml soy sauce (preferably high-quality, such as Tomasu or Kikkoman) {scale}
- Leaves from 3 sprigs of fresh thyme, finely chopped {scale}
- 12 scallops {scale}
- Black pepper, to taste
- Leaves from 1 sprig of fresh thyme (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Peel the mango and puree half of the flesh using a food processor, blender, or immersion blender. Cut the other half into small cubes and refrigerate, covered.

2. Heat a skillet with a knob of butter over medium heat. Sauté the shallot and red chili for a few minutes until softened.

3. Lower the heat and add the mango puree to the pan. Stir in 10 ml of soy sauce and the finely chopped thyme. Let the mixture simmer on low heat for a few minutes, then taste and adjust with more soy sauce if needed. The sauce should have a balance of sweet, salty, and spicy flavors.

4. Allow the sauce to cool and store it in the refrigerator until ready to use.

5. When ready to serve, reheat the sauce on low heat and stir in the refrigerated mango cubes.

6. Heat a skillet over medium heat with a knob of butter. Once the butter stops foaming, add the scallops to the pan. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and sear for 1.5–2 minutes on each side until golden brown. The inside should remain slightly raw.

7. Arrange 3 scallops on each plate (preferably pre-warmed). Sprinkle with a pinch of freshly ground black pepper, spoon the mango sauce over the scallops, and garnish with fresh thyme leaves. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- For a different texture, you can grill the scallops in a grill pan. Brush them with a neutral oil before grilling for 1.5–2 minutes per side.
- This dish pairs well with a Pinot Gris from Alsace, which complements the thyme and mango flavors without overpowering the dish.
