A surprising combination of sweet white chocolate mousse with a spicy red pepper jelly layer. The subtle heat from the red pepper beautifully contrasts with the creamy sweetness of the white chocolate.

2. Remove seeds from the red pepper and cut into strips.

3. Heat 100 ml apple juice with the pepper strips, do not let it boil. Let it steep for about 10 minutes.

6. Let cool to room temperature.

### White Chocolate Mousse
