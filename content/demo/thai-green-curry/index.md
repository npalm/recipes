A fragrant and creamy Thai green curry with tender chicken and crisp vegetables. The homemade curry paste makes all the difference, but store-bought works great too.

## Ingredients

- 680g chicken thighs, cut into pieces {scale}
- 30g green curry paste {scale}
- 400ml coconut milk {scale}
- 240ml chicken broth {scale}
- 15ml fish sauce {scale}
- 15g palm sugar or brown sugar {scale}
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced {scale}
- 150g Thai eggplant, quartered {scale}
- 150g bamboo shoots {scale}
- 20g Thai basil leaves {scale}
- 2-3 kaffir lime leaves {scale}
- 30ml vegetable oil {scale}
- Jasmine rice for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large wok or deep pan over medium-high heat. Add the thick part of the coconut milk (the cream on top) and cook for 2 minutes until it starts to separate.

2. Add the green curry paste and fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly.

3. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is sealed on all sides.

4. Pour in the remaining coconut milk and chicken broth. Add the fish sauce and sugar. Stir well.

5. Add the kaffir lime leaves and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.

6. Add the bell pepper, eggplant, and bamboo shoots. Continue cooking for another 8-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through.

7. Remove from heat and stir in the Thai basil leaves.

8. Serve hot over jasmine rice.

## Notes

- Adjust the amount of curry paste based on your spice preference.
- Thai eggplant can be substituted with regular eggplant or zucchini.
- For a vegetarian version, use tofu and vegetable broth instead of chicken.
