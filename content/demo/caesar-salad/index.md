## Ingredients

- 2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped {scale}
- 100g homemade croutons {scale}
- 50g freshly grated Parmesan cheese {scale}
- 2-3 anchovy fillets (optional) {scale}

### For the Dressing

- 2 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 2 anchovy fillets, mashed {scale}
- 30ml fresh lemon juice {scale}
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard {scale}
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce {scale}
- 1 egg yolk {scale}
- 120ml extra virgin olive oil {scale}
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### For the Croutons

- 150g cubed day-old bread {scale}
- 45ml olive oil {scale}
- 2 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Make the croutons: Preheat oven to 190°C. Toss bread cubes with olive oil, garlic, and salt. Spread on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes until golden and crispy. Set aside to cool.

2. Make the dressing: In a large wooden bowl, mash the garlic and anchovies together with a fork until it forms a paste.

3. Whisk in the lemon juice, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.

4. Add the egg yolk and whisk until smooth.

5. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking constantly until the dressing is emulsified and creamy.

6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Add the chopped romaine to the bowl and toss to coat evenly with the dressing.

8. Add the croutons and half of the Parmesan, tossing gently.

9. Serve immediately, topped with the remaining Parmesan and extra anchovy fillets if desired.

## Notes

- For food safety, you can use pasteurized egg yolks or skip the egg entirely for a lighter dressing.
- Add grilled chicken or shrimp to make it a complete meal.
- The dressing can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
