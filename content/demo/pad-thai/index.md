Thailand's most famous noodle dish - sweet, sour, and savory rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, tofu, eggs, and crunchy peanuts. A perfect balance of flavors and textures.

## Ingredients

### For the Sauce

- 3 tablespoons tamarind paste {scale}
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce {scale}
- 2 tablespoons palm sugar or brown sugar {scale}
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar {scale}

### For the Pad Thai

- 8 oz flat rice noodles (pad thai noodles) {scale}
- 8 oz large shrimp, peeled and deveined {scale}
- 4 oz firm tofu, pressed and cubed {scale}
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil {scale}
- 3 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced {scale}
- 2 eggs {scale}
- 1 cup bean sprouts {scale}
- 3 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces {scale}
- 1/4 cup roasted peanuts, chopped {scale}
- 1/4 cup dried shrimp (optional) {scale}
- 2 tablespoons preserved radish, chopped (optional) {scale}

### For Serving

- Fresh lime wedges
- Extra bean sprouts
- Chili flakes or fresh Thai chilies
- Fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Soak the rice noodles in room temperature water for 30-60 minutes until pliable but still firm. Drain and set aside.

2. Mix together all sauce ingredients in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

3. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Cook the tofu until golden on all sides, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.

4. Add another tablespoon of oil. Cook the shrimp until pink, about 2 minutes. Remove and set aside with the tofu.

5. Add the remaining oil to the wok. Add garlic and shallots, stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant.

6. Add the drained noodles and the sauce. Toss constantly for 2-3 minutes until noodles are soft and have absorbed the sauce.

7. Push noodles to one side. Crack the eggs into the empty space, scramble briefly, then mix with the noodles.

8. Add the cooked shrimp, tofu, dried shrimp, and preserved radish. Toss to combine.

9. Add bean sprouts and green onions. Toss for 30 seconds - they should stay crisp.

10. Serve immediately, topped with chopped peanuts, with lime wedges and extra garnishes on the side.

## Notes

- The key to good pad thai is high heat and fast cooking - have all ingredients prepped before you start.
- Don't oversoak the noodles or they'll become mushy. They should still be slightly firm before cooking.
- Tamarind paste can be found in Asian grocery stores - it's essential for authentic flavor.
- For vegetarian version, use soy sauce instead of fish sauce and skip the shrimp.
