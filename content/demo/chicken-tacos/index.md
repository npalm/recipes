Juicy, flavorful chicken tacos inspired by Mexican street vendors. Marinated chicken, fresh toppings, and warm corn tortillas make these irresistible.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken

- 680g boneless chicken thighs {scale}
- 45ml vegetable oil {scale}
- 3 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 30ml lime juice {scale}
- 1 tablespoon chili powder {scale}
- 1 teaspoon cumin {scale}
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano {scale}
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For Serving

- 12 small corn tortillas {scale}
- 1 white onion, finely diced {scale}
- 25g fresh cilantro, chopped {scale}
- 2 limes, cut into wedges {scale}
- Salsa verde or roja
- Crumbled queso fresco (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine oil, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Add chicken thighs and marinate for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight in the refrigerator).

2. Heat a cast iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken thighs for 5-6 minutes per side until charred and cooked through (internal temperature of 75°C).

3. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes, then chop into small pieces.

4. Warm the corn tortillas on a dry skillet or directly over a gas flame until soft and slightly charred.

5. Assemble the tacos: Place chicken on each tortilla, top with diced onion and cilantro.

6. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and queso fresco on the side.

## Notes

- Double-stack the tortillas if they're thin to prevent breaking.
- For extra flavor, cook the chicken in the rendered fat from some bacon or chorizo.
- These tacos are also great with grilled pineapple chunks added on top.
- Leftover chicken makes excellent quesadillas or burrito bowls.
