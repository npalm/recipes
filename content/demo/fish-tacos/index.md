## Components

### Beer-Battered Fish

#### Ingredients

- 450g firm white fish (cod or hake), cut into strips {scale}
- 125g all-purpose flour {scale}
- 65g cornstarch {scale}
- 1 teaspoon baking powder {scale}
- 1 teaspoon salt {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder {scale}
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper {scale}
- 240ml cold beer (lager works best) {scale}

#### Instructions

1. Pat fish strips dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.
3. Pour in the cold beer and whisk until smooth. The batter should be slightly thick but pourable.
4. Heat oil in a deep pan or Dutch oven to 190°C.
5. Dip fish strips into the batter, letting excess drip off, and carefully lower into the hot oil.
6. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy.
7. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with a pinch of salt immediately.

### Citrus Slaw

#### Ingredients

- 200g shredded green cabbage {scale}
- 70g shredded purple cabbage {scale}
- 50g julienned carrots {scale}
- 15g fresh cilantro, chopped {scale}
- 30ml lime juice {scale}
- 15ml orange juice {scale}
- 30ml olive oil {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin {scale}
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. Combine both cabbages, carrots, and cilantro in a large bowl.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, orange juice, olive oil, cumin, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat evenly.
4. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Can be made up to 2 hours ahead.

### Chipotle Crema

#### Ingredients

- 120ml sour cream {scale}
- 60ml mayonnaise {scale}
- 1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo, minced {scale}
- 15ml adobo sauce {scale}
- 15ml lime juice {scale}
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder {scale}
- Salt to taste

#### Instructions

1. Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, minced chipotle peppers, and adobo sauce in a bowl.
2. Add lime juice and garlic powder, then whisk until smooth.
3. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt. Add more chipotle for extra heat if desired.
4. Refrigerate until ready to use. Keeps for up to 5 days.

### Assembly

#### Ingredients

- 8 small corn or flour tortillas
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Lime wedges for serving
- Pickled jalapeños (optional)

#### Instructions

1. Warm tortillas in a dry skillet or directly over a gas flame until pliable and slightly charred.
2. Place a portion of crispy fish in each tortilla.
3. Top with a generous amount of citrus slaw.
4. Drizzle with chipotle crema.
5. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side.
6. Add pickled jalapeños for extra kick if desired.

## Notes

- The key to crispy fish is making sure the oil is at the right temperature. Use a thermometer!
- For a lighter version, skip the batter and simply pan-sear seasoned fish with a little oil.
- The slaw and crema can both be made ahead, making this great for entertaining.
- Corn tortillas are traditional, but flour tortillas work great too.
