A rich and creamy beef stroganoff with tender strips of beef, earthy mushrooms, and a silky sour cream sauce. Serve over egg noodles for the ultimate comfort meal.

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef sirloin, cut into thin strips {scale}
- 1 lb cremini mushrooms, sliced {scale}
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced {scale}
- 4 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 2 tablespoons butter {scale}
- 2 tablespoons olive oil {scale}
- 1/4 cup brandy or cognac (optional) {scale}
- 2 cups beef broth {scale}
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste {scale}
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard {scale}
- 1 cup sour cream {scale}
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour {scale}
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
- Egg noodles for serving

## Instructions

1. Season the beef strips generously with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil in a large skillet over high heat. Working in batches, sear the beef strips for 1-2 minutes per side until browned. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

3. Reduce heat to medium. Add the remaining butter and oil to the pan. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes until softened.

4. Add the mushrooms and cook for another 5-7 minutes until golden and most of the liquid has evaporated.

5. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

6. If using brandy, add it now and carefully ignite to flambé (or simply let it reduce for 1-2 minutes).

7. Stir in the tomato paste and mustard. Cook for 1 minute.

8. Pour in the beef broth and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes.

9. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and flour until smooth. Slowly stir this mixture into the sauce.

10. Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pan. Simmer for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens and the beef is heated through.

11. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

12. Serve immediately over hot egg noodles, garnished with fresh parsley.

## Notes

- Don't overcook the beef - it should be pink in the center when you first sear it, as it will continue cooking in the sauce.
- For a lighter version, use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
- This dish is even better the next day after the flavors have melded together.
- Can be served over rice or mashed potatoes instead of noodles.
