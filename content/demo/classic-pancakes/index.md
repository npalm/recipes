Light, fluffy buttermilk pancakes that are perfect for a weekend breakfast. The buttermilk gives them a subtle tang and incredibly tender texture.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour {scale}
- 2 tablespoons sugar {scale}
- 2 teaspoons baking powder {scale}
- 1 teaspoon baking soda {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon salt {scale}
- 2 cups buttermilk {scale}
- 2 large eggs {scale}
- 1/4 cup melted butter {scale}
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract {scale}
- Butter for cooking
- Maple syrup for serving

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy - don't overmix!

4. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a small pat of butter.

5. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.

6. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown on the bottom.

7. Serve immediately with butter and maple syrup.

## Notes

- For extra fluffy pancakes, let the batter rest for 5 minutes before cooking.
- If you don't have buttermilk, add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to regular milk and let it sit for 5 minutes.
- Keep cooked pancakes warm in a 200°F oven while cooking the rest.
