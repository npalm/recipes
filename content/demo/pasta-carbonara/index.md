The classic Roman pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, guanciale, and black pepper. No cream needed - the silky sauce comes from perfectly emulsified eggs and pasta water.

## Ingredients

- 450g spaghetti or rigatoni {scale}
- 225g guanciale or pancetta, cut into small cubes {scale}
- 4 large egg yolks {scale}
- 2 whole eggs {scale}
- 100g freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese {scale}
- 50g freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano {scale}
- Freshly ground black pepper (generous amount)
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to boil for the pasta.

2. While waiting, whisk together the egg yolks, whole eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a bowl. Season generously with black pepper.

3. Cut the guanciale into small cubes or strips. Place in a cold skillet, then turn heat to medium. Cook slowly until the fat renders and the meat is crispy, about 8-10 minutes.

4. Cook the pasta in the boiling water until al dente, about 1 minute less than package directions. Reserve 240ml of pasta water before draining.

5. Remove the skillet from heat and let it cool for 1 minute (this is crucial - if too hot, the eggs will scramble).

6. Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the guanciale. Toss to coat in the rendered fat.

7. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss vigorously, adding splashes of pasta water as needed to create a creamy, silky sauce that coats each strand.

8. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino and black pepper on top.

## Notes

- The key is temperature control - the residual heat should cook the eggs into a creamy sauce, not scrambled eggs.
- Guanciale (cured pork jowl) is traditional, but pancetta or good bacon work well too.
- Use the best quality eggs you can find - they make a huge difference.
- Never add cream - authentic carbonara gets its creaminess from the egg and cheese emulsion.
