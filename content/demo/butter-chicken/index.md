Rich, creamy, and aromatic - this butter chicken (murgh makhani) rivals any restaurant. Tender marinated chicken in a velvety tomato-based sauce that's mildly spiced and utterly delicious.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken Marinade

- 2 lbs boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks {scale}
- 1 cup plain yogurt {scale}
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice {scale}
- 2 teaspoons garam masala {scale}
- 1 teaspoon turmeric {scale}
- 1 teaspoon cumin {scale}
- 1 teaspoon paprika {scale}
- 1 teaspoon salt {scale}
- 4 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 1 inch ginger, grated {scale}

### For the Sauce

- 4 tablespoons butter {scale}
- 1 large onion, finely diced {scale}
- 4 cloves garlic, minced {scale}
- 1 inch ginger, grated {scale}
- 2 teaspoons garam masala {scale}
- 1 teaspoon cumin {scale}
- 1 teaspoon coriander {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste) {scale}
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes {scale}
- 1 cup heavy cream {scale}
- 2 tablespoons honey or sugar {scale}
- 1 teaspoon salt {scale}
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions

1. Combine all marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

2. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Arrange marinated chicken on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 15-20 minutes until charred on edges and cooked through.

3. While chicken bakes, make the sauce. Melt butter in a large deep pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and golden, about 8 minutes.

4. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

5. Add garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Stir for 30 seconds to bloom the spices.

6. Pour in the crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly.

7. Use an immersion blender to puree the sauce until smooth (or transfer to a blender and blend carefully).

8. Stir in the heavy cream, honey, and salt. Simmer for another 5 minutes.

9. Add the baked chicken pieces to the sauce. Simmer together for 5-10 minutes so the chicken absorbs the flavors.

10. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, alongside basmati rice and warm naan bread.

## Notes

- Marinating overnight makes a huge difference in flavor and tenderness.
- For a lighter version, use coconut cream instead of heavy cream.
- This dish tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop.
- The sauce can be made ahead and frozen for up to 3 months.
- Add a tablespoon of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) for an authentic restaurant taste.
