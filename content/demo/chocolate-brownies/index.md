Rich, fudgy chocolate brownies with a crackly top and gooey center. These are the ultimate chocolate treat that's surprisingly easy to make.

## Ingredients

- 225g unsalted butter {scale}
- 400g sugar {scale}
- 4 large eggs {scale}
- 100g cocoa powder {scale}
- 1/2 teaspoon salt {scale}
- 1 teaspoon baking powder {scale}
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract {scale}
- 125g all-purpose flour {scale}
- 175g chocolate chips (optional) {scale}

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 175°C. Line a 23x33cm baking pan with parchment paper and grease lightly.

2. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar.

3. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.

4. Stir in the cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and vanilla extract until well combined.

5. Gently fold in the flour until just incorporated. Add chocolate chips if using.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.

7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs (not wet batter).

8. Let cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.

## Notes

- For extra fudgy brownies, slightly underbake them.
- Add 100g of chopped walnuts or pecans for crunch.
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
- These freeze beautifully for up to 3 months.
